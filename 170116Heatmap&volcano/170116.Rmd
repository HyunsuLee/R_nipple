## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
# Data load & library load
require(reshape2)
require(gplots)
require(preprocessCore)
require(RColorBrewer)
require(ggplot2)

data <- read.csv("garza_heatmap.csv", header = TRUE)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, include=FALSE}
# data matrix conversion
